First thing to to is enter a vehicle into the system via the prompt.  More vehicles may be added through the main menu.
Next step is to enter any tasks you wish to be tracked. The automobile manufacturer should have a recommended maintenance schedule that can be found on their website or the vehicle operators manual.  Each task along with their interval and mileage last completed is entered.

Make sure to periodically update the vehicle mileage to get an accurate idea of when tasks are coming due.

There may be unscheduled tasks completed that can be added into the maintenance log as well as any scheduled item done.  These can be entered through the vehicle menu.  The vehicle logs will show all tasks completed as well as their costs and date completed.
